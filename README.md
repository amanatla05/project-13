This file is for project 13.
I have added some problems solved from  LeetCode, Hackerrank, and CodeWars in this repository.


Challenge #1 : LeetCode
1.Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.last() method on any array and it will return the last element. If there are no elements in the array, it should return -1.

You may assume the array is the output of JSON.parse.

/**
 * @return {null|boolean|number|string|Array|Object}
 */
Array.prototype.last = function() {
  
};

/**
 * const arr = [1, 2, 3];
 * arr.last(); // 3
 */


Challenge #2 CodeWars
2.Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single one. The arrays only contain integers. Also, the final outcome must be sorted and not have any duplicate.
